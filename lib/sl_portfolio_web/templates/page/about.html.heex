  <p class="bio">
    In 2020 as a recent poli-sci grad I did a complete 180 and decided to learn how to build software.  Now, I'm employed by BCIT and do freelance work
    on the side.  My favourite programming language is <a

    > <b class="elixir">Elixir</b></a>, but most often work with JavaScript and Python.
